RESEARCH


Madison Explorations, Inc. (M D E X . P K; 0.36) S.T. Target 2.75

cranny lysergic copperhead that ferocity flatland

There are those rare times when the decision to invst in a particular
stck or industry is a no-brainer: homeland security in the wake of 9-11,
gold in the fall of 2001, and China in early 2002, for example, to  
name a
few prescient calls. The Canadian diamond industry and diamond explorer
Madison Explorations present us with just such a unique opportunity.

alveolar telemeter eloise issuant dwindle roister

Madison Explorations: An Invstor's Best Friend:
The Northwest Territories has been the preferred target area for diamond
explorers. Shore Gold's discovery of a 19.7 carat rock at its Star  
Diamond
Project last year intensified exploration in Saskatchewan, the second  
most
active exploration area in the Northwest Territories as measured by  
money
inflows. Madison Explorations is the most active explorer in Southern  
Saskatchewan.
That includes the De Beers-Kensington partnership. Madison's primary  
area
of exploration is Scout Lake, which, according to the Saskatchewan  
Geological
Survey, is one of the two most promising diamond areas in the province.
That conclusion confirms the work of Dr. Joseph Montgomery, the director
of five mining companies and Madision's lead diamond explorer. Dr.  
Montgomery
has spent more than a decade surveying the area. He is a person of  
considerable
expertise and is exceptionally well regarded in the metals and minerals
discovery business. Dr. Montgomery has been involved in more than 300
prosperous mineral explorations all over the world, including  
projects for
Diamond Fields. Based on his ten years surveying Scout Lake, Dr.  
Montgomery
believes it is one of the most promising diamond locations he's ever  
seen
and that the area could be home to the largest diamond deposit in the  
province
Madison is the only active explorer in Scout Lake, which, from a  
geological
standpoint, has many of the same characteristics as Fort à la Corne,  
where
Shore Gold made last year's spectacular discovery. Madison is currently
exploring two other potential diamond properties in Southern  
Saskatchewan,
Bulls-eye and Bronco. The results of early indicator studies at both  
properties
have been very favorable.Winspear, Dia-Met, and Aber each partnered  
with a
more senior diamond producer. Madison is currently the only active  
explorer
in one of the most potentially diamond-rich regions within a national  
industry
that is experiencing dazzling growth and whose full potential is only
just now being tapped. We would not be surprised to see Madison follow
the trend and partner up with a De Beers, for instance. In the meantime,
look for additional diamond property acquisitions and discoveries by
this aggressive upstart - and for substantial share price appreciation
over the mid- to long-term.

Shres trade in New York under the ticker symbol MDEX. Current price  
per share
is just 0.36 cents, nearly 300% above its September low.  
Opportunities as
clear and sparkling as this one come along rarely.

MediStem Laboratories (OTC BB: MDSM): The Nike of Stem Cell Technology
Today's edition is a "first look" at an exciting new company.  
Admittedly, there isn't a wealth of information on MDSM's technology.  
Over the next two months a lot more will be known. On October 12,  
2005, Medistem completed a reverse take over, and became a publicly  
traded company. 
We do know this: MDSM now possesses the technology to treat patients  
with Stem Cells, and plans to begin doing so through an International  
licensee in the next couple of months. I've looked at several stem  
cell opportunities, all of whom claimed they had the greatest IP on  
the planet. This company is planning on actually using their IP to  
treat patients in the near term. That fact makes them very unique.
 

What Are Stem Cells?


In preparing for this edition, I did a little research and learned  
there is a wealth of misinformation and misconception about what Stem  
Cells actually are and why they are controversial. In short, Stem  
Cells are cells from which other types of cells can develop. Stem  
cells are cells capable, by successive divisions, of producing  
specialized cells on many different levels.
Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them.  
First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long  
periods through cell division. The second is that under certain  
physiologic or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become  
cells with special functions. They can actually seek out a damaged  
area, and morph into the required cells to replace damaged or  
defective cells.
There are two kinds of stem cells: Adult and embryonic. Each of us  
still has stem cells, and they can easily be extracted from our  
blood. However, fetal stem cells are far more robust and active.
Within fetal stem cells there are controversial and non controversial  
versions. The controversial stem cells come from aborted fetuses-  
it's the moral issue that makes them controversial. Non controversial  
stem cells come from the placentas and umbilical chords of healthy  
births.
MDSM works only with non controversial stem cells for both ethical  
and scientific reasons. On the moral side, as a public company they  
want to avoid the issue. On the scientific side, the company believes  
it stands a better chance of getting a good result for patients using  
stem cells from a healthy birth rather than an unknown. 
 

Medistem's Technology

MDSM possesses some very interesting technology. First and foremost,  
they have technology which allows them to significantly multiply the  
number of stem cells in the lab. They can take a sampling and use it  
to literally "farm" millions more. There are no animal proteins  
involved the process, so the stem cells are replicated in an  
untainted manner. MDSM has the ability to turn 1 million stem cells  
into upwards of 500 million.
Early treatments indicate it can require vast quantities of stem  
cells to get a result for a subject. Therefore, the ability to  
reproduce the cells in the lab puts the company in a position to  
offer treatments at a reasonable cost. 
Today, after the market closed, MSDM announced it acquired the world  
wide rights to a cancer therapy using stem cells. According to the  
patent application for this new therapy, these stem cells "have  
demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing cancer cells to  
differentiate into benign, non-malignant cells". The MDSM portfolio  
of available stem cell technology is growing.
 

The "Nike" of the Stem Cell World


When I think of Nike the phrase "Just Do It" is imbedded in my brain.  
In the stem cell treatment world, MDSM has devised a way to "Just Do  
It". There is enough clinical data around to support the thesis that  
stem cells can be highly effective treatments, particularly for  
untreatable neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Cerebral  
Palsy, and strokes. They have proved effective in treating blood  
disorders such as Leukemia. These little guys get into your body, go  
find the defective cells, and turn into the healthy cells that should  
be there.
Here's where this story becomes really interesting. MDSM has a  
licensee arrangement with the Institute for Cellular Medicine (ICM)  
in Costa Rica. ICM is a licensee of MDSM technology. Within the next  
two months, ICM will be open for business in San Juan, Costa Rica,  
and be treating stroke victims with Stem Cells. MDSM will provide its  
technology, and collect licensing fees for each treatment.
The Costa Rican government views Stem Cell therapy as akin to blood  
transfusions vs viewing the treatment as a new drug. Therefore, the  
standard protocols of screening for bacteria, aids, or any other  
agent that might taint blood are all that apply.
Once the Costa Rican clinic is operational, MDSM will be pursuing  
other international opportunities, and hopes to license 9 to 12 more  
clinics worldwide over the course of the next year.
I can't find any other public company that is pursuing this course.  
Two possible outcomes could prove valuable to shareholders: 1.  
Revenues would be generated in the near term, and 2. The company will  
be able to accumulate a wealth of intellectual property and data on  
individual patients who have been treated. The data could become a  
valuable asset to the company.
 

Conclusion


Here's a chart showing the price performance of MDSM since completing  
the RTO. As you can see, there is nothing technical we can derive  
from this chart besides noting that the stock is at the very low end  
of its trading range. However, since it is still virtually unknown  
and under followed by investors, the price and volume action don't  
mean much.
Of far greater interest is the fact that MDSM possesses the ability  
to reproduce stem cells in large enough quantities for treatments at  
a reasonable cost to the patient. The company anticipates being in a  
position to see the treatments in action within the next two months.  
Not only will this generate revenues, it will also generate valuable  
data.
Market value wise, the bar has been set fairly high on this one. The  
former company issued 100 million shares of stock to acquire  
MediStem. The founder of MediStem, Dr. Neil Riordan, now owns 80% of  
the company. According to one report I have, there are now 125  
million shares I&O, but anecdotally I have heard estimates that the  
available free trading shares are in the 9 million range. With the  
limited history, the roughly $60 million market value is pricey, but  
some of the market caps in the Stem Cell sector are completely off  
the charts. 
I expect the story to develop over the next two months. We will have  
a better idea of the proprietary nature of their stem cell  
technology, names for advisory panels, clinics opening and patients  
being treated, and a myriad of other unpredictable developments to  
explore.
Consider this a "first look" at a very exciting company in one of the  
hottest sectors in the market. The stock has plenty of upside from  
current levels, especially if the float is limited. An opening  
position in the $.50 to $.60 range is suggested, holding back some  
capital for market volatility and a maturing story. If you own the  
stock in the $.50 to $.60 range, a stop loss at $.40 is suggested and  
prudent.
Here is the complete text of today's press release for your review:

Medistem Acquires Worldwide Patent Pending Rights to Potential Stem  
Cell Treatment for a Variety of Cancers
Wednesday February 1, 4:01 pm ET
Proprietary Stem Cell Technology has Demonstrated Ability to Trigger  
Cancer Cells to Behave Like Normal Cells
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 1, 2006--Medistem  
Laboratories, Inc. (OTCBB:MDSM - News; FWB:S2U), committed to the  
ethical development of next-generation medical therapies from non- 
controversial adult stem cell sources, announced it has acquired  
exclusive worldwide rights to a potential treatment for cancer that  
uses stem cells to reprogram malignant cells to behave like normal  
cells.
The patent pending technology has the potential to lead to the  
development of anticancer treatments for a variety of the most  
serious and widespread cancers. The invention was discovered by Dr.  
Thomas Ichim, a Medistem consultant.
"This new patent pending strengthens Medistem's intellectual property  
portfolio," said Neil Riordan, Ph.D., CEO of Medistem. "It is an  
example of the promise of stem cell-based technology to enable the  
creation of medical therapies that could revolutionize the treatment  
of cancer and other serious medical conditions."
The technology described in the patent application focuses on stem  
cell therapies that have demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing  
cancer cells to differentiate into benign, non-malignant cells. The  
patent pending pertains specifically to the use of stem cells derived  
from adult sources, such as umbilical cords and placentas from  
healthy, full-term births.
Medistem believes the newly acquired patent pending may provide  
doctors and cancer patients with an entirely new avenue of treatment  
options. "While chemotherapy and radiation therapy induce severe side  
effects through collateral damage to non-cancerous cells and organs,  
the present invention utilizes the ability of cancer cells to be  
'reprogrammed' into benign, non-cancerous progeny," said Dr. Ichim.
Recently published research conducted at Northwestern University with  
federally approved human embryonic stem cell lines has demonstrated  
the ability of stem cells to successfully reprogram malignant  
melanoma cells into cells that behave like normal skin cells. This  
work adds credence to the newly acquired patent pending.
About Medistem Laboratories, Inc.
Medistem Laboratories is an innovative biotechnology company  
committed to the creation and commercialization of advanced medical  
therapies based on non-controversial adult stem cells. Medistem's  
corporate mission is to transform these stem cells into valuable  
medical treatments. The Company intends to create these treatments  
from adult stem cells derived from muscle, bone marrow and fat of  
adult patients seeking treatment, as well as from full-term, healthy  
placentas and umbilical cords, but not the controversial embryonic or  
fetal stem cells that are the focus of ethical and moral debates in  
some communities. The Company's business strategy calls for the  
establishment of a series of clinics and laboratories around the  
world to deliver unprecedented, next-generation cell therapies to  
help millions of patients. Initial development and treatment focus  
will use proprietary technology and cells sourced from umbilical  
cords, fat, bone marrow, and muscle for advanced treatment of  
cerebral palsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease and orthopedic  
diseases, primarily for the international marketplace. Additional  
applications, ultimately be targeted to the treatment of neurological  
disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and certain types of  
cancer. Medistem believes it may hold a substantial competitive edge  
in the worldwide emerging market for stem cell-sourced medical  
solutions, positioning it to become a leading global provider of stem  
cell treatments on a fee-for-service basis, while accumulating  
intellectual property based on clinical and laboratory findings. For

  Features: Digging Deep into CDW. New Digest Additions.


There seems to be some controversy surrounding mid-cap hardware and  
software seller/solutions company CDW Corp (NASDAQ: CDWC). Seems  
there’s a group of investors who want to talk this one down. Stats  
show that there is a whopping 7 percent short position of the 80  
million shares outstanding. Call us contrarians, but why? Short term  
I smell a squeeze. Long-term it looks a winner; let’s dig deeper.
CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries engage in the direct marketing  
of multi-brand computers, and related technology products and  
services in the United States. CDW is a principal source of  
technology from top name brands such as Adobe, APC, Apple, Cisco, HP,  
IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Sony, Symantec, Toshiba and ViewSonic.
CDW has almost $575 million in cash and no debt. Sales for 2005 were  
$6.29 billion ($5.7 billion for 2004) against a market cap of $4.5  
billion. The p/e against 2005 earnings of $3.29 against a share price  
of $56 is 17 times. For 2006 and 2007 the projected numbers are $3.24  
and $3.47 respectively for p/e’s of 17 times and 16 times. The  
company bought back $258 million of its own shares in 2005 and paid  
out $35 million in dividends. Other than a slight decline in sales  
for 2006—which is fairly common--not seeing the problem so far.
For the reasons above and below, investors should use the current  
price weakness in CDW to accumulate shares for the long-term.

Maybe the technical picture is crappy:
Apparently not. While we wouldn’t be surprised to see CDW pullback  
to the $50 area and blow out the weaklings before it steams into a  
serious up move, the chart looks constructive enough that one could  
buy here and on dips. Our technical target settles out at around $85- 
$90, so a couple of bucks here or there is likely irrelevant. 
The market for computers and peripherals is roughly $100 billion a  
year and growing. While CDW ain’t no Google from a momentum  
perspective—thankfully--revenues and earnings have been increasing  
nicely; growth has been consistent and frankly quite impressive over  
the last few years. 
Sexy? Mais non. Even the dozen or so analysts that follow the company  
are firmly on the fence with a wussy buy rating of 2.5 out of 5.  
Curious.
And, as an aside, I’ve ordered stuff in the past from CDW. Smooth.  
Fast. Good prices. I, and dare I say the majority of consumers,  
don’t need much more.
The financial ratios are also really good. Price to sales is less  
than 1 at around .72. You don’t see that very often. Microsoft has a  
p/s ratio of over 7.  As well, CDW’s PEG ratio is a solid 1 which  
gives virtually no value to any future growth surprises/expansion. We  
think that’s a mistake.  Microsoft’s PEG is 1.62. 
The CDW story is surprisingly simple. It sells computers, software  
and electronics stuff. And over the last few years it has sold more  
and more. Our interest in the stock is two-fold. First, we believe  
that the current market price does not reflect the growth to date and  
investors appear needlessly worried that revenues will slow. Second,  
the future growth appears robust as the company opens new sales  
channels and obviously builds its brand as a premier site to get the  
latest and greatest products worldwide.
And for those reasons, investors should own the shares long-term.  
Doesn’t get more complicated than that.
By the way, for the more aggressive traders among us, CDW is  
optionable. Have a look at the expiries and strike prices and see if  
either suits your time horizon and risk profile.
And, if you haven't already noticed, check out our new sidenotes  
column for up-to-date market calls, alerts and more. Stay tuned.

Option Alert: INTC
On January 18th, we looked at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and suggested the  
06April 22.50 calls if they could be snagged for under $1. Currently  
they are 55 cents a contract and the 06April20 calls are $1.90 good  
value with the shares at $21.43. Might want to check out longer  
expiries if April seems too soon. Once the brouhaha regarding the  
overreaction to the last numbers release cools, there is likely a  
nice bounce coming. Straight option purchases are for aggressive  
investors only.
 
Making Sense
Sense Holdings (OTCBB: SEHO) looking perky as volumes increase and  
the shares look like they want to break 30 cents. Company recently  
announced further measures to ramp up development of the handheld  
explosives/narcotics/biological threat detection device. Obviously  
landing on more investors’ radar screens. Will keep readers informed  
as developments warrant. Getting extremely interesting.
 
Profit Alert: MRK
We noted on the SCBLOG that we’re taking profits on Merck (NYSE:  
MRK) as it has moved up to $34.50 from our call in August 05 at under  
$26. The intelligentsia got scared off due to Vioxx concerns, but our  
work showed the price then already reflected that concern and the  
technical picture looked good. Now it’s approaching the old high and  
even if it takes that out we see a sell-off coming. Any entries here  
should have tight stops.
 
INFA Takeout Target?
Kind of the same scenario with Informatica (NASDAQ: INFA) also noted  
on the SCBLOG. As the shares crossed $15 and earnings were skookum,  
it may still get taken out, but a tight stop to protect profits or on  
new purchases would be wise. We have been on this one since $7.50, so  
taking at least a bit off the table would be prudent. Or at least  
protect a large slug of profit.

Comment:
I agree with Reas and Fry when they contend that processing was meant  
primarliy as a educational tool and an opportunity for those without  
a strong backgorund in java or c.  I never did any programming  
outside of max/msp before looking at processing.  I can understand  
that there is a great deal of copying and pasting, but that  is part  
of the process of learning.  For those who feel they need to learn  
more, they will explore the deeper implications of working with code  
to produce art.  Honestly, this situation is not as dire as toxi  
makes it out to be.  Many people are being exposed to a radically new  
way of conceptualizing their approaches towards creative work through  
exposure to computational media, which they might have been turned  
away from through the normally steep learning curve otherwise.  So  
what is the big deal?  I think it's a good thing in the long run.   
Fundamentally, good art does not need to be about a mastery of the  
tools used.  Many "outsider artists" have !
  contributed enormously to our aesthetic imagination.

 From the creators of Boozy and the OBIE Award-Winning A Very Merry  
Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant...
Les Freres Corbusier presents

By Elizabeth Meriwether
Directed by Alex Timbers
Produced by Aaron Lemon-Strauss

February 8-February 25
All Performances at 8:30pm

HERE Arts Center
145 Sixth Avenue, C/E to Spring

Tickets: $15 through SmartTix
212-868-4444 | www.heddatron.com

Les Freres Corbusier continues its irreverent massacre of historical  
icons and academic esoterica by taking on famed playwright Henrik  
Ibsen, the well-made play, and contemporary issues in robotics. Ibsen  
is thwarted by August Strindberg and his kitchen slut throughout his  
fevered struggle to write the great feminist drama, Hedda Gabler,  
while a contemporary housewife in Michigan is abducted by robots and  
forced to perform Ibsen's masterpiece over and over again...

With real functioning robots portraying half of the parts, alongside  
humans who will play the other half, Heddatron will be one of the  
first theatrical productions to use functional robots as actors.  
Employing robotic automation and text-to-speech software, humans will  
perform opposite a hunky Lovborg-bot, a clunky Tessman-bot, as well  
as blinking, smoking, and whirring co-stars who portray Judge Brack,  
Aunt Julie, and the rest of Ibsen's menagerie.

I was an animator who never thought a computer code could be  
considered a work of art. However after I learned Processing, I  
changed a lot. Because even though I had no ideas about code before,  
it helped to me to get me a sense of computational art. Also, because  
there were many accessible sources, I could easily get more familiar  
with it and see beauty in it got interesting to computational art.  
Now I am more curious about computational art, so I would like to

Thank you for your recent e-mail.  As the New York State Democratic  
Leader,
your comments are very important to me.  While I receive thousands of
correspondence each year, rest assured that my staff and I carefully  
read
each letter and e-mail that comes in.   I will certainly keep your  
thoughts
in mind while working with my colleagues to shape public policy and  
draft
important legislation.

Indeed, I believe public input is an essential part of the legislative
process.  Your opinions and recommendations will be of great help to  
me as
we work on the critical issues facing New York.  I hope and expect  
the 2005
legislative session to be a watershed for government reform.

If you have not already done so, please forward your name and address  
to my
office.  This allows me to stay in touch and keep you up to date on the
important issues that affect you.

Again, thank you for your e-mail.  I applaud your activism and interest.
If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to  
contact my
office.

Sincerely,

David A. Paterson,
Senate Democratic Leader

another few hours trying to make stuff work around the house.  
Frankly, it's worse at home than in the office. In fact, today's  
wired homes put most offices to shame. At the office, the most  
challenging tasks are getting a print job to finish on a networked

RESEARCH

Madison Explorations, Inc. (MDEX.PK; 0.36) S.T. Target 2.75

There are those rare times when the decision to invst in a particular
stck or industry is a no-brainer: homeland security in the wake of 9-11,
gold in the fall of 2001, and China in early 2002, for example, to  
name a
few prescient calls. The Canadian diamond industry and diamond explorer
Madison Explorations present us with just such a unique opportunity.

pcnimq kes amlx bergland wop

Canadian Diamonds: An Industry in the Rough Canada is entering only its
sixth year as a diamond player, but already it's the world's #3 diamond
producer, behind Botswana and Russia. From 2002 to 2003, Canadian  
diamond
production more than doubled to 11.2 million carats. In a very short  
time,
Canada has gone from a non-entity in the diamond biz to a supplier of  
about
15% of the world's rough diamonds. Today, nearly half of all funding for
diamond exploration goes to Canada.

xkqkvq yxz mhhc coniferous associable

Even more impressive than the huge growth itself is the fact that  
that huge
growth has come on the strength of just two active diamond mines: Ekati,
jointly operated by Dia-Met and BHP, and Diavik, jointly operated by
Aber and Rio Tinto. Tahera's Jericho Mine will go online next year. Snap
Lake, a joint venture between De Beers and Winspear - is slated for full
production in 2007. It will propel Canada passed Russia into the #2 spot
amongst the world's diamond producers - with just four active mines! In
terms of end-market, Canadian diamonds have a crucial advantage over the
competition: Unlike diamonds from Angola, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, for
instance - "blood diamonds" used to finance bloody political conflict,
Canadian diamonds are "clean." Consumers' preference for clean diamonds
is one of the reasons Tiffany struck a deal with Tahera to buy or market
all the diamonds Tahera's Jericho Mine produces. Tiffany refuses to sell
"blood diamonds."

Madison Explorations: An Invstor's Best Friend:
The Northwest Territories has been the preferred target area for diamond
explorers. Shore Gold's discovery of a 19.7 carat rock at its Star  
Diamond
Project last year intensified exploration in Saskatchewan, the second  
most
active exploration area in the Northwest Territories as measured by  
money
inflows. Madison Explorations is the most active explorer in Southern  
Saskatchewan.
That includes the De Beers-Kensington partnership. Madison's primary  
area
of exploration is Scout Lake, which, according to the Saskatchewan  
Geological
Survey, is one of the two most promising diamond areas in the province.
That conclusion confirms the work of Dr. Joseph Montgomery, the director
of five mining companies and Madision's lead diamond explorer. Dr.  
Montgomery
has spent more than a decade surveying the area. He is a person of  
considerable
expertise and is exceptionally well regarded in the metals and minerals
discovery business. Dr. Montgomery has been involved in more than 300
prosperous mineral explorations all over the world, including  
projects for
Diamond Fields. Based on his ten years surveying Scout Lake, Dr.  
Montgomery
believes it is one of the most promising diamond locations he's ever  
seen
and that the area could be home to the largest diamond deposit in the  
province
Madison is the only active explorer in Scout Lake, which, from a  
geological
standpoint, has many of the same characteristics as Fort à la Corne,  
where
Shore Gold made last year's spectacular discovery. Madison is currently
exploring two other potential diamond properties in Southern  
Saskatchewan,
Bulls-eye and Bronco. The results of early indicator studies at both  
properties
have been very favorable.Winspear, Dia-Met, and Aber each partnered  
with a
more senior diamond producer. Madison is currently the only active  
explorer
in one of the most potentially diamond-rich regions within a national  
industry
that is experiencing dazzling growth and whose full potential is only
just now being tapped. We would not be surprised to see Madison follow
the trend and partner up with a De Beers, for instance. In the meantime,
look for additional diamond property acquisitions and discoveries by
this aggressive upstart - and for substantial share price appreciation
over the mid- to long-term.

Shres trade in New York under the ticker symbol MDEX. Current price  
per share
is just 0.36 cents, nearly 300% above its September low.

no case to answer.

They heard that Smith, 21, had sheared off ex Michelle Turner's

Article:
Turbo Charge Your Job Search



By Sue Levine, M.Ed., Career Placement Representative

It's the little things that sometimes differentiate you from your  
competitors when it comes to a job search. Students often wonder why  
they didn't receive a job offer when "I'm qualified and did a great  
job answering the interview questions." Job searching is not an exact  
science - there is not always a tangible explanation as to why you  
weren’t offered a job, but there are some things you can do to stack  
the odds in your favor.

Thank You Notes
While a thank you note alone will not guarantee a job offer, all  
things being equal it can differentiate you from another candidate.  
It tells the employer that you have taken extra effort to thank them  
for their time and that you are serious about the position. It also  
speaks to your character - you have demonstrated proper etiquette and  
social norms. Email is a perfectly fine way to get a brief thank you  
out to an employer in a timely manner, but follow up with a hard copy  
thank you letter for formality.

Be on Time for the Interview
First impressions are everything! If you arrive late to an interview,  
even minutes, you are sending a message to the employer that you  
don't value time. Employers want employees who are timely, and you  
should set the stage for this at the interview phase. Some simple tips:

1. Map out your route and plan your commute based on the time of day,  
parking availability, traffic, etc.
2. Drive the route ahead of time if it is an unfamiliar local.
3. If you will be traveling during rush hour or on public  
transportation - allow for extra time.
4. If you don't own a cell phone - borrow one for a few hours. If you  
are running late you can easily call the employer.

Know Something about the Job and the Employer
You don't need to know every minute detail, but you should do some  
research prior to the interview. Woe to the jobseeker who cannot  
articulate why they are interested in the position. This sends the  
message that you are not overly serious about the position.

Follow the directions for online applications
Some employers require that you submit an online application. This is  
often another way to screen candidates. Did you follow the  
instructions? Submit everything that they asked for? Were you able to  
navigate the system successfully? These things can tell the employer  
a great deal about your comfort with technology and ability to follow  
specific directions. Apply online when you know you have  
uninterrupted time and you can pay attention to what you are doing.

Don't Wear Perfume, Cologne, or other Scented Products to the Interview
While you may think that your Chanel No. 5 is the most heavenly scent  
on the earth that may not be true for the other people in the  
interview room.

Be Nice to the Receptionist and Administrative Staff
The hiring manager may seek input from other staff members that are  
not even in the interview room. A smile, friendly demeanor, and  
overall professional attitude can send a positive message.

Sue Levine, M.Ed. is a Career Placement Representative at  
Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester, Massachusetts and has  
nearly ten years of experience working in Career Services. She holds  
a B.A. in English and American Literature from Brandeis University  
and a M. Ed. in Higher Education from the University of Georgia.

Subject: Your Debts Could Make You Rich!


Your Debts Could Make You Rich!

Your debts disappear (even your house is paid off) in 5-7 years, and  
you retire debt-free... using nothing more than the money you're  
currently earning plus one of today's best-kept secrets:

Does my story sound too familiar?

I should've seen it, because each day I dressed myself in clothes  
paid for by credit cards, walked on financed carpet in our mortgaged  
house, and drove a leased car.

But even when the company I worked for went under and I found myself  
scrambling to keep from losing the house, cars, furniture, and our  
good name, I still didn't see it. Then, a couple of days later, when  
I was forced to sell my gold Corvette and my wife's Olds Regency, it  
hit me: I was a prisoner of debt.

As long as I owed people money, they owned me! At that moment, I made  
myself a promise: "I will never be this vulnerable again!" I had to  
find a way out of debt. And that's exactly what I did. But in the  
process, I developed a unique method that transforms debt into  
wealth. So much wealth, that anyone who uses it can be a millionaire  
by the time he or she retires. And best of all ... you can accumulate  
your $1 million nest egg using nothing more than the money you're  
currently earning.

And it's easy: One year after I explained my method to Jan and Jerrel  
Herron (both in their 50s), their credit cards and two cars were paid  
off. In the second year, they paid off the mortgage. Then they showed  
my method to their 32-year-old twin sons. One son quickly paid off  
his house. The other paid his off one year later.

The same happened to Ruth DeHaven of Santee, CA: "We were over  
$125,000 in debt. Today, just 3 years later, we are completely debt- 
free, including no mortgage on our house, and my husband and I have  
just retired at age 55."

And Dale Prull, from San Jose, CA, says, "After only 8 months all my  
credit cards were paid off. Ten months later my car was paid off. The  
value of my home is over $400,000 and will be paid off in 3 years and  
4 months. Following your plan, I'll retire 12 years later with almost  
$1 million."

Over half a million people are using my method, and now it's your turn.

Stop being a prisoner of debt today! Discover how good it feels to  
wake up each morning knowing you own your car, house, and everything  
you have, and you don't owe a penny to anyone. No more bills in the  
mailbox.

My method transforms your debt into wealth - growing to $1 million -  
using nothing more than the money you're currently earning. Thanks to  
the best-kept secret of the investment industry, you're in control of  
your life: free, financially independent - enjoying peace of mind,  
knowing your family is safe and you're set for life!

See how it works today: http://sedicigreatproducts13.com/t/c/186/data/ 
dz15.html

Sincerely,
John Cummuta

P.S. Don't make another payment on your home, car, or credit card  
until you hear the truth of today's 5 biggest rip-offs - from some of  
America's largest, most-trusted names. Stop making others rich, while  
they keep you poor - a prisoner of debt. Break free today ... and  
transform your debt into wealth.

Hey you, Avis

You know why I take pleasure in internet shopping? Because it's fun!
Yesterday I was looking over this timepiece at this e-store and today I
decided to grab it. I see you cutting down on nice things every week.  
This
is not too expensive so that you can let yourself go!
http://ypp.qra.meetingourexpectation.com/juh/

You deserve to have a luxury accessory and it won't cost much. You  
won't be
required to wait long for it because the consignment is so speedy.

You'll be even more stunning than others!

Get ready to have some fun,

Jonah

Subject: Valentine's Day

Hello Everyone,

Love, Relationships and Commitment, isn't that what Valentine's Day is
all about? Well so is Chasing Erections, but you get a side order of
laughter as well. And not only will Chasing Erections make you laugh,
but it will make you think and it will make you feel. When was the last
time a movie gave you all that?

And as a bonus you can pretend to all your friends that you just bought
a porn film. I can't tell you how many people think Chasing Erections
is porn. I believe that's one of the reasons that they're so moved
after watching the film. They're not expecting what they get. And isn't
that one of the fun things in life, unpredictability.

This Valentine's Day be UNPREDICTABLE and bring home a copy of Chasing
Erections. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.


Regards,

Hedley Turk

Comments in the BLOG


I put up a new BLOG today on DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM), the subject of  
the weekend edition. Apparently, it's going to take a big swoon in  
the market to knock this stock off track. I suggested using caution  
when trying to buy this one, but out of front of the pending FDA  
Approval the stock has made a new all time high today. Again, a  
partial position to get started, saving some capital for a pullback,  
is suggested. In the BLOG I note that based on where the stock is  
trading today, a good upside target for the FDA Approval might be  
around $25.
We have had some technical problems with the BLOG recently, mostly  
related to the massive amounts of spam we get in the comment section.  
Several of the recent comments and questions have accidentally been  
deleted. If you have posted a comment or question, and don't see it  
responded to in the BLOG, please resubmit. Sorry if this problem has  
caused any inconvenience.
To use the BLOG, simply go to the home page at www.otcjournal.com -  
the BLOG will scroll down automatically on the right side of your  
screen. The most current journal entries appear in the middle of your  
screen. Check back frequently for updates particularly when stocks  
are moving to overbought or oversold levels or in volatile markets.  
Your questions and postings do not automatically appear, so don't  
bother posting the same question multiple times. I personally go  
through to moderate and respond to every reasonable question.
 

Coming Attractions
In the next 10 days I'll be making the jump back to a couple of good  
old fashioned penny stocks from this past weekend's $16 idea. For  
starters, I have identified a stock in the $.50 range in the heavily  
followed Stem Cell space. This will be an OTC Journal first look  
edition. This company looks interesting because they are not just  
claiming to have some great Stem Cell IP- they are actually putting a  
mechanism in place to begin offering real Stem Cell treatments using  
non controversial stem cells. This new idea may come out as early as  
tomorrow after the close.
Then, next week I'm going to introduce another penny stock lovers  
delight. It's in the $.08 range, but has traded as high as $.13  
already this year, and had a 10 million share day in January. The  
company has some very exciting technology for utilities, and is  
teaming up with a huge household name company to market the product.
Stand by for some new ideas. Now is the time to start building on  
this year's successes.
Also, we are introducing a new format for the newsletter today. Note  
the new right hand column. I will use this new column to highlight  
either new BLOG postings or events you should know about. Today,  
there is some coverage on this morning's news release from OTC  
Journal winner TelePlus (OTC BB: TLPE). This stock is now storing up  
energy for it's next streaky move, and is at the ideal level for  
accumulation.
News From TLPE
TLPE was out with news before the open today. The company is clearly  
making a major commitment to the pre paid market. They are hosting a  
big conference in late March. Look for them to be a leader in this  
field. Yes the complete text of today's release:

that its wholly-owned subsidiary, TelePlus Wireless, Corp. ("TelePlus

of the upcoming Intele-CardExpo in Miami, Florida. The prestigious  
event, which will take place from March 21-23, 2006, is the leading  
world venue where the prepaid industry meets, transacts, and  
networks. Organizers of the Expo expect over 5,000 attendees from all  
areas of the prepaid industry, including the wireless, telecom,  
distribution, payment, and next-generation technology segments. As  
the Expo has historically had a high proportion of top executives,  
final decision makers, and experts amongst attendees, TelePlus  
Wireless, as an event sponsor, is well-positioned to gain valuable  
industry exposure. To ensure maximum visibility for its flagship  
brand, TelePlus Wireless will also be exhibiting a Liberty Wireless  
booth at the Expo.
"The Intele-CardExpo is an ideal venue for TelePlus to showcase its  
impressive array of prepaid services since all aspects of the  
industry are covered at the Expo under one roof," stated Kelly  
McLaren, President of TelePlus. "As an event sponsor, our primary  
objectives will be to create top-of-mind awareness for the Liberty  
Wireless brand in particular and, more generally, to position  
TelePlus as the supplier-of-choice for the industry's prepaid-service  
needs. As an exhibitor, we also intend to take full advantage of the  
many networking opportunities offered by the Expo to strengthen our  
strategic business relationships with distributors, corporate and  
vertical market end-users, and next-gen providers. We have an  
exciting year ahead of us, and the Expo is the perfect opportunity to  
explain our winning story to the prepaid community," stated Ms. McLaren.

Subject: From Mr.Walter Schemid.

 From Mr.Walter Schemid.
Abidjan,Cote d'ivoire,
West Africa.
Email:(walchem4@yahoo.fr)

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this
letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it
serious. This letter must come to you as a big surprise,
but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become
great friends and business partners. My name is Mr.Walter
Schemid, the present branch accountant of a bank here in
Abidjan Cote d'ivoire.  I write you this proposal in good
faith, believing that I can trust you with the information
I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a
transaction that will benefit both of us, as your
assistance is required as a foreigner.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head
office, but last December I was asked to take position of
account Manager of our branch in Abidjan  who passed on, so
that was how I became the present account manager and
discovered a fortune.  As I resumed duty, I discovered an
account with total sum of $18,500,000 million that has not
been operated on for the past 4 years.  From my
investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one
Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great industrialist
and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life
in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only
daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on
visiting this site which I got during my investigation;
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
The account is escrow call account, a secret type of
account in my bank and no other person knows about this
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no
other beneficiary.  I have kept a close monitoring of the
account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about
the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson,
meaning that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot
directly take out this money without the help of a
foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an
assistance to claim the funds and share it with me.  As the
Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence
the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as
the next of kin to the account, with the correct
information concerning the account, which I shall give you.

I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next
of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will
release the funds to yous.  There is practically no risk
involved, the transaction will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of law.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both
parties will be  satisfied.

Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel
we can work together, so we can go over the details.
  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please,
treat with utmost confidentiality.  I wait your urgent
response. You can as well contact through this my private
email at(walchem4@yahoo.fr)
Regards,

Mr.Walter Schemid.

RESEARCH


Madison Explorations, Inc. (M D E X . P K; 0.36) S.T. Target 2.75

cranny lysergic copperhead that ferocity flatland

There are those rare times when the decision to invst in a particular
stck or industry is a no-brainer: homeland security in the wake of 9-11,
gold in the fall of 2001, and China in early 2002, for example, to  
name a
few prescient calls. The Canadian diamond industry and diamond explorer
Madison Explorations present us with just such a unique opportunity.

Madison Explorations: An Invstor's Best Friend:
The Northwest Territories has been the preferred target area for diamond
explorers. Shore Gold's discovery of a 19.7 carat rock at its Star  
Diamond
Project last year intensified exploration in Saskatchewan, the second  
most
active exploration area in the Northwest Territories as measured by  
money
inflows. Madison Explorations is the most active explorer in Southern  
Saskatchewan.
That includes the De Beers-Kensington partnership. Madison's primary  
area
of exploration is Scout Lake, which, according to the Saskatchewan  
Geological
Survey, is one of the two most promising diamond areas in the province.
That conclusion confirms the work of Dr. Joseph Montgomery, the director
of five mining companies and Madision's lead diamond explorer. Dr.  
Montgomery
has spent more than a decade surveying the area. He is a person of  
considerable
expertise and is exceptionally well regarded in the metals and minerals
discovery business. Dr. Montgomery has been involved in more than 300
prosperous mineral explorations all over the world, including  
projects for
Diamond Fields. Based on his ten years surveying Scout Lake, Dr.  
Montgomery
believes it is one of the most promising diamond locations he's ever  
seen
and that the area could be home to the largest diamond deposit in the  
province
Madison is the only active explorer in Scout Lake, which, from a  
geological
standpoint, has many of the same characteristics as Fort à la Corne,  
where
Shore Gold made last year's spectacular discovery. Madison is currently
exploring two other potential diamond properties in Southern  
Saskatchewan,
Bulls-eye and Bronco. The results of early indicator studies at both  
properties
have been very favorable.Winspear, Dia-Met, and Aber each partnered  
with a
more senior diamond producer. Madison is currently the only active  
explorer
in one of the most potentially diamond-rich regions within a national  
industry
that is experiencing dazzling growth and whose full potential is only
just now being tapped. We would not be surprised to see Madison follow
the trend and partner up with a De Beers, for instance. In the meantime,
look for additional diamond property acquisitions and discoveries by
this aggressive upstart - and for substantial share price appreciation
over the mid- to long-term.

Shres trade in New York under the ticker symbol MDEX. Current price  
per share
is just 0.36 cents, nearly 300% above its September low.  
Opportunities as
clear and sparkling as this one come along rarely.

MediStem Laboratories (OTC BB: MDSM): The Nike of Stem Cell Technology
Today's edition is a "first look" at an exciting new company.  
Admittedly, there isn't a wealth of information on MDSM's technology.  
Over the next two months a lot more will be known. On October 12,  
2005, Medistem completed a reverse take over, and became a publicly  
traded company. 
We do know this: MDSM now possesses the technology to treat patients  
with Stem Cells, and plans to begin doing so through an International  
licensee in the next couple of months. I've looked at several stem  
cell opportunities, all of whom claimed they had the greatest IP on  
the planet. This company is planning on actually using their IP to  
treat patients in the near term. That fact makes them very unique.
 

What Are Stem Cells?


In preparing for this edition, I did a little research and learned  
there is a wealth of misinformation and misconception about what Stem  
Cells actually are and why they are controversial. In short, Stem  
Cells are cells from which other types of cells can develop. Stem  
cells are cells capable, by successive divisions, of producing  
specialized cells on many different levels.
Stem cells have two important characteristics that distinguish them.  
First, they are unspecialized cells that renew themselves for long  
periods through cell division. The second is that under certain  
physiologic or experimental conditions, they can be induced to become  
cells with special functions. They can actually seek out a damaged  
area, and morph into the required cells to replace damaged or  
defective cells.
There are two kinds of stem cells: Adult and embryonic. Each of us  
still has stem cells, and they can easily be extracted from our  
blood. However, fetal stem cells are far more robust and active.
Within fetal stem cells there are controversial and non controversial  
versions. The controversial stem cells come from aborted fetuses-  
it's the moral issue that makes them controversial. Non controversial  
stem cells come from the placentas and umbilical chords of healthy  
births.
MDSM works only with non controversial stem cells for both ethical  
and scientific reasons. On the moral side, as a public company they  
want to avoid the issue. On the scientific side, the company believes  
it stands a better chance of getting a good result for patients using  
stem cells from a healthy birth rather than an unknown. 
 

Medistem's Technology

MDSM possesses some very interesting technology. First and foremost,  
they have technology which allows them to significantly multiply the  
number of stem cells in the lab. They can take a sampling and use it  
to literally "farm" millions more. There are no animal proteins  
involved the process, so the stem cells are replicated in an  
untainted manner. MDSM has the ability to turn 1 million stem cells  
into upwards of 500 million.
Early treatments indicate it can require vast quantities of stem  
cells to get a result for a subject. Therefore, the ability to  
reproduce the cells in the lab puts the company in a position to  
offer treatments at a reasonable cost. 
Today, after the market closed, MSDM announced it acquired the world  
wide rights to a cancer therapy using stem cells. According to the  
patent application for this new therapy, these stem cells "have  
demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing cancer cells to  
differentiate into benign, non-malignant cells". The MDSM portfolio  
of available stem cell technology is growing.
 

The "Nike" of the Stem Cell World


When I think of Nike the phrase "Just Do It" is imbedded in my brain.  
In the stem cell treatment world, MDSM has devised a way to "Just Do  
It". There is enough clinical data around to support the thesis that  
stem cells can be highly effective treatments, particularly for  
untreatable neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Cerebral  
Palsy, and strokes. They have proved effective in treating blood  
disorders such as Leukemia. These little guys get into your body, go  
find the defective cells, and turn into the healthy cells that should  
be there.
Here's where this story becomes really interesting. MDSM has a  
licensee arrangement with the Institute for Cellular Medicine (ICM)  
in Costa Rica. ICM is a licensee of MDSM technology. Within the next  
two months, ICM will be open for business in San Juan, Costa Rica,  
and be treating stroke victims with Stem Cells. MDSM will provide its  
technology, and collect licensing fees for each treatment.
The Costa Rican government views Stem Cell therapy as akin to blood  
transfusions vs viewing the treatment as a new drug. Therefore, the  
standard protocols of screening for bacteria, aids, or any other  
agent that might taint blood are all that apply.
Once the Costa Rican clinic is operational, MDSM will be pursuing  
other international opportunities, and hopes to license 9 to 12 more  
clinics worldwide over the course of the next year.
I can't find any other public company that is pursuing this course.  
Two possible outcomes could prove valuable to shareholders: 1.  
Revenues would be generated in the near term, and 2. The company will  
be able to accumulate a wealth of intellectual property and data on  
individual patients who have been treated. The data could become a  
valuable asset to the company.
 

Conclusion


Here's a chart showing the price performance of MDSM since completing  
the RTO. As you can see, there is nothing technical we can derive  
from this chart besides noting that the stock is at the very low end  
of its trading range. However, since it is still virtually unknown  
and under followed by investors, the price and volume action don't  
mean much.
Of far greater interest is the fact that MDSM possesses the ability  
to reproduce stem cells in large enough quantities for treatments at  
a reasonable cost to the patient. The company anticipates being in a  
position to see the treatments in action within the next two months.  
Not only will this generate revenues, it will also generate valuable  
data.
Market value wise, the bar has been set fairly high on this one. The  
former company issued 100 million shares of stock to acquire  
MediStem. The founder of MediStem, Dr. Neil Riordan, now owns 80% of  
the company. According to one report I have, there are now 125  
million shares I&O, but anecdotally I have heard estimates that the  
available free trading shares are in the 9 million range. With the  
limited history, the roughly $60 million market value is pricey, but  
some of the market caps in the Stem Cell sector are completely off  
the charts. 
I expect the story to develop over the next two months. We will have  
a better idea of the proprietary nature of their stem cell  
technology, names for advisory panels, clinics opening and patients  
being treated, and a myriad of other unpredictable developments to  
explore.
Consider this a "first look" at a very exciting company in one of the  
hottest sectors in the market. The stock has plenty of upside from  
current levels, especially if the float is limited. An opening  
position in the $.50 to $.60 range is suggested, holding back some  
capital for market volatility and a maturing story. If you own the  
stock in the $.50 to $.60 range, a stop loss at $.40 is suggested and  
prudent.

Medistem Acquires Worldwide Patent Pending Rights to Potential Stem  
Cell Treatment for a Variety of Cancers
Wednesday February 1, 4:01 pm ET
Proprietary Stem Cell Technology has Demonstrated Ability to Trigger  
Cancer Cells to Behave Like Normal Cells
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 1, 2006--Medistem  
Laboratories, Inc. (OTCBB:MDSM - News; FWB:S2U), committed to the  
ethical development of next-generation medical therapies from non- 
controversial adult stem cell sources, announced it has acquired  
exclusive worldwide rights to a potential treatment for cancer that  
uses stem cells to reprogram malignant cells to behave like normal  
cells.
The patent pending technology has the potential to lead to the  
development of anticancer treatments for a variety of the most  
serious and widespread cancers. The invention was discovered by Dr.  
Thomas Ichim, a Medistem consultant.
"This new patent pending strengthens Medistem's intellectual property  
portfolio," said Neil Riordan, Ph.D., CEO of Medistem. "It is an  
example of the promise of stem cell-based technology to enable the  
creation of medical therapies that could revolutionize the treatment  
of cancer and other serious medical conditions."
The technology described in the patent application focuses on stem  
cell therapies that have demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing  
cancer cells to differentiate into benign, non-malignant cells. The  
patent pending pertains specifically to the use of stem cells derived  
from adult sources, such as umbilical cords and placentas from  
healthy, full-term births.
Medistem believes the newly acquired patent pending may provide  
doctors and cancer patients with an entirely new avenue of treatment  
options. "While chemotherapy and radiation therapy induce severe side  
effects through collateral damage to non-cancerous cells and organs,  
the present invention utilizes the ability of cancer cells to be  
'reprogrammed' into benign, non-cancerous progeny," said Dr. Ichim.
Recently published research conducted at Northwestern University with  
federally approved human embryonic stem cell lines has demonstrated  
the ability of stem cells to successfully reprogram malignant  
melanoma cells into cells that behave like normal skin cells. This  
work adds credence to the newly acquired patent pending.
About Medistem Laboratories, Inc.
Medistem Laboratories is an innovative biotechnology company  
committed to the creation and commercialization of advanced medical  
therapies based on non-controversial adult stem cells. Medistem's  
corporate mission is to transform these stem cells into valuable  
medical treatments. The Company intends to create these treatments  
from adult stem cells derived from muscle, bone marrow and fat of  
adult patients seeking treatment, as well as from full-term, healthy  
placentas and umbilical cords, but not the controversial embryonic or  
fetal stem cells that are the focus of ethical and moral debates in  
some communities. The Company's business strategy calls for the  
establishment of a series of clinics and laboratories around the  
world to deliver unprecedented, next-generation cell therapies to  
help millions of patients. Initial development and treatment focus  
will use proprietary technology and cells sourced from umbilical  
cords, fat, bone marrow, and muscle for advanced treatment of  
cerebral palsy, stroke, cardiovascular disease and orthopedic  
diseases, primarily for the international marketplace. Additional  
applications, ultimately be targeted to the treatment of neurological  
disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and certain types of  
cancer. Medistem believes it may hold a substantial competitive edge  
in the worldwide emerging market for stem cell-sourced medical  
solutions, positioning it to become a leading global provider of stem  
cell treatments on a fee-for-service basis, while accumulating  
intellectual property based on clinical and laboratory findings. For

Comments in the BLOG

 

Between KAL, HDY, DXCM, and TLPE it's been a big picnic lately.  
However, a black cloud hovered over the picnic this morning in the  
form of a major negative event for Dermisonics (OTC BB: DMSI). There  
is a new BLOG covering the event. In the microcap arena, sometimes  
things don't go your way. If you have an interest, read the BLOG.
To use the BLOG, simply go to the home page at www.otcjournal.com -  
the BLOG will scroll down automatically on the right side of your  
screen. The most current journal entries appear in the middle of your  
screen. Check back frequently for updates particularly when stocks  
are moving to overbought or oversold levels or in volatile markets.  
Your questions and postings do not automatically appear, so don't  
bother posting the same question multiple times. I personally go  
through to moderate and respond to every reasonable question.

  Features: Digging Deep into CDW. New Digest Additions.


There seems to be some controversy surrounding mid-cap hardware and  
software seller/solutions company CDW Corp (NASDAQ: CDWC). Seems  
there’s a group of investors who want to talk this one down. Stats  
show that there is a whopping 7 percent short position of the 80  
million shares outstanding. Call us contrarians, but why? Short term  
I smell a squeeze. Long-term it looks a winner; let’s dig deeper.
CDW Corporation and its subsidiaries engage in the direct marketing  
of multi-brand computers, and related technology products and  
services in the United States. CDW is a principal source of  
technology from top name brands such as Adobe, APC, Apple, Cisco, HP,  
IBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Sony, Symantec, Toshiba and ViewSonic.
CDW has almost $575 million in cash and no debt. Sales for 2005 were  
$6.29 billion ($5.7 billion for 2004) against a market cap of $4.5  
billion. The p/e against 2005 earnings of $3.29 against a share price  
of $56 is 17 times. For 2006 and 2007 the projected numbers are $3.24  
and $3.47 respectively for p/e’s of 17 times and 16 times. The  
company bought back $258 million of its own shares in 2005 and paid  
out $35 million in dividends. Other than a slight decline in sales  
for 2006—which is fairly common--not seeing the problem so far.
For the reasons above and below, investors should use the current  
price weakness in CDW to accumulate shares for the long-term.

Maybe the technical picture is crappy:
Apparently not. While we wouldn’t be surprised to see CDW pullback  
to the $50 area and blow out the weaklings before it steams into a  
serious up move, the chart looks constructive enough that one could  
buy here and on dips. Our technical target settles out at around $85- 
$90, so a couple of bucks here or there is likely irrelevant. 
The market for computers and peripherals is roughly $100 billion a  
year and growing. While CDW ain’t no Google from a momentum  
perspective—thankfully--revenues and earnings have been increasing  
nicely; growth has been consistent and frankly quite impressive over  
the last few years. 
Sexy? Mais non. Even the dozen or so analysts that follow the company  
are firmly on the fence with a wussy buy rating of 2.5 out of 5.  
Curious.
And, as an aside, I’ve ordered stuff in the past from CDW. Smooth.  
Fast. Good prices. I, and dare I say the majority of consumers,  
don’t need much more.
The financial ratios are also really good. Price to sales is less  
than 1 at around .72. You don’t see that very often. Microsoft has a  
p/s ratio of over 7.  As well, CDW’s PEG ratio is a solid 1 which  
gives virtually no value to any future growth surprises/expansion. We  
think that’s a mistake.  Microsoft’s PEG is 1.62. 
The CDW story is surprisingly simple. It sells computers, software  
and electronics stuff. And over the last few years it has sold more  
and more. Our interest in the stock is two-fold. First, we believe  
that the current market price does not reflect the growth to date and  
investors appear needlessly worried that revenues will slow. Second,  
the future growth appears robust as the company opens new sales  
channels and obviously builds its brand as a premier site to get the  
latest and greatest products worldwide.
And for those reasons, investors should own the shares long-term.  
Doesn’t get more complicated than that.
By the way, for the more aggressive traders among us, CDW is  
optionable. Have a look at the expiries and strike prices and see if  
either suits your time horizon and risk profile.
And, if you haven't already noticed, check out our new sidenotes  
column for up-to-date market calls, alerts and more. Stay tuned.

Option Alert: INTC
On January 18th, we looked at Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and suggested the  
06April 22.50 calls if they could be snagged for under $1. Currently  
they are 55 cents a contract and the 06April20 calls are $1.90 good  
value with the shares at $21.43. Might want to check out longer  
expiries if April seems too soon. Once the brouhaha regarding the  
overreaction to the last numbers release cools, there is likely a  
nice bounce coming. Straight option purchases are for aggressive  
investors only.
 
Making Sense
Sense Holdings (OTCBB: SEHO) looking perky as volumes increase and  
the shares look like they want to break 30 cents. Company recently  
announced further measures to ramp up development of the handheld  
explosives/narcotics/biological threat detection device. Obviously  
landing on more investors’ radar screens. Will keep readers informed  
as developments warrant. Getting extremely interesting.
 
Profit Alert: MRK
We noted on the SCBLOG that we’re taking profits on Merck (NYSE:  
MRK) as it has moved up to $34.50 from our call in August 05 at under  
$26. The intelligentsia got scared off due to Vioxx concerns, but our  
work showed the price then already reflected that concern and the  
technical picture looked good. Now it’s approaching the old high and  
even if it takes that out we see a sell-off coming. Any entries here  
should have tight stops.
 
INFA Takeout Target?
Kind of the same scenario with Informatica (NASDAQ: INFA) also noted  
on the SCBLOG. As the shares crossed $15 and earnings were skookum,  
it may still get taken out, but a tight stop to protect profits or on  
new purchases would be wise. We have been on this one since $7.50, so  
taking at least a bit off the table would be prudent. Or at least  
protect a large slug of profit.

Comment:
I agree with Reas and Fry when they contend that processing was meant  
primarliy as a educational tool and an opportunity for those without  
a strong backgorund in java or c.  I never did any programming  
outside of max/msp before looking at processing.  I can understand  
that there is a great deal of copying and pasting, but that  is part  
of the process of learning.  For those who feel they need to learn  
more, they will explore the deeper implications of working with code  
to produce art.  Honestly, this situation is not as dire as toxi  
makes it out to be.  Many people are being exposed to a radically new  
way of conceptualizing their approaches towards creative work through  
exposure to computational media, which they might have been turned  
away from through the normally steep learning curve otherwise.  So  
what is the big deal?  I think it's a good thing in the long run.   
Fundamentally, good art does not need to be about a mastery of the  
tools used.  Many "outsider artists" have !
  contributed enormously to our aesthetic imagination.

Les Freres Corbusier presents

By Elizabeth Meriwether
Directed by Alex Timbers
Produced by Aaron Lemon-Strauss

February 8-February 25
All Performances at 8:30pm

HERE Arts Center
145 Sixth Avenue, C/E to Spring

Tickets: $15 through SmartTix

Les Freres Corbusier continues its irreverent massacre of historical  
icons and academic esoterica by taking on famed playwright Henrik  
Ibsen, the well-made play, and contemporary issues in robotics. Ibsen  
is thwarted by August Strindberg and his kitchen slut throughout his  
fevered struggle to write the great feminist drama, Hedda Gabler,  
while a contemporary housewife in Michigan is abducted by robots and  
forced to perform Ibsen's masterpiece over and over again...

With real functioning robots portraying half of the parts, alongside  
humans who will play the other half, Heddatron will be one of the  
first theatrical productions to use functional robots as actors.  
Employing robotic automation and text-to-speech software, humans will  
perform opposite a hunky Lovborg-bot, a clunky Tessman-bot, as well  
as blinking, smoking, and whirring co-stars who portray Judge Brack,  
Aunt Julie, and the rest of Ibsen's menagerie.

Comment:
I was an animator who never thought a computer code could be  
considered a work of art. However after I learned Processing, I  
changed a lot. Because even though I had no ideas about code before,  
it helped to me to get me a sense of computational art. Also, because  
there were many accessible sources, I could easily get more familiar  
with it and see beauty in it got interesting to computational art.  
Now I am more curious about computational art, so I would like to  
study it more deeply. ¡®Processing¡¯ was helpful to learn Program.

Comment:
I was an animator who never thought a computer code could be  
considered a work of art. However after I learned Processing, I  
changed a lot. Because even though I had no ideas about code before,  
it helped to me to get me a sense of computational art. Also, because  
there were many accessible sources, I could easily get more familiar  
with it and see beauty in it got interesting to computational art.  
Now I am more curious about computational art, so I would like to  
study it more deeply. ¡®Processing¡¯ was helpful to learn Program.

Thank you for your recent e-mail.  As the New York State Democratic  
Leader,
your comments are very important to me.  While I receive thousands of
correspondence each year, rest assured that my staff and I carefully  
read
each letter and e-mail that comes in.   I will certainly keep your  
thoughts
in mind while working with my colleagues to shape public policy and  
draft
important legislation.

Indeed, I believe public input is an essential part of the legislative
process.  Your opinions and recommendations will be of great help to  
me as
we work on the critical issues facing New York.  I hope and expect  
the 2005
legislative session to be a watershed for government reform.

If you have not already done so, please forward your name and address  
to my
office.  This allows me to stay in touch and keep you up to date on the
important issues that affect you.

Again, thank you for your e-mail.  I applaud your activism and interest.
If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to  
contact my
office.

Sincerely,

David A. Paterson,

 From the Monster Blog: The Office Geek Goes Home

Monster Blogger Ryck posts: In my first blog post on Monster, I  
announced my retirement as the office geek. This past weekend I spent  
another few hours trying to make stuff work around the house.  
Frankly, it's worse at home than in the office. In fact, today's  
wired homes put most offices to shame. At the office, the most  
challenging tasks are getting a print job to finish on a networked  
printer (multipage .pdf files with embedded graphics practically  
guarantee a printer queue traffic jam) or figuring out how to reserve  
a conference room using Outlook's scheduling features. But at home...

Quick Tip: Keep Your Resume Handy

If you're actively searching for a job, always keep a copy of your

for an interview. You'll be able to reference it if you're asked  
questions about your career progression or key qualifications. -- Kim

RESEARCH

Madison Explorations, Inc. (MDEX.PK; 0.36) S.T. Target 2.75

There are those rare times when the decision to invst in a particular
stck or industry is a no-brainer: homeland security in the wake of 9-11,
gold in the fall of 2001, and China in early 2002, for example, to  
name a
few prescient calls. The Canadian diamond industry and diamond explorer
Madison Explorations present us with just such a unique opportunity.

pcnimq kes amlx bergland wop

Canadian Diamonds: An Industry in the Rough Canada is entering only its
sixth year as a diamond player, but already it's the world's #3 diamond
producer, behind Botswana and Russia. From 2002 to 2003, Canadian  
diamond
production more than doubled to 11.2 million carats. In a very short  
time,
Canada has gone from a non-entity in the diamond biz to a supplier of  
about
15% of the world's rough diamonds. Today, nearly half of all funding for
diamond exploration goes to Canada.

xkqkvq yxz mhhc coniferous associable

Even more impressive than the huge growth itself is the fact that  
that huge
growth has come on the strength of just two active diamond mines: Ekati,
jointly operated by Dia-Met and BHP, and Diavik, jointly operated by
Aber and Rio Tinto. Tahera's Jericho Mine will go online next year. Snap
Lake, a joint venture between De Beers and Winspear - is slated for full
production in 2007. It will propel Canada passed Russia into the #2 spot
amongst the world's diamond producers - with just four active mines! In
terms of end-market, Canadian diamonds have a crucial advantage over the
competition: Unlike diamonds from Angola, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, for
instance - "blood diamonds" used to finance bloody political conflict,
Canadian diamonds are "clean." Consumers' preference for clean diamonds
is one of the reasons Tiffany struck a deal with Tahera to buy or market
all the diamonds Tahera's Jericho Mine produces. Tiffany refuses to sell
"blood diamonds."

Madison Explorations: An Invstor's Best Friend:
The Northwest Territories has been the preferred target area for diamond
explorers. Shore Gold's discovery of a 19.7 carat rock at its Star  
Diamond
Project last year intensified exploration in Saskatchewan, the second  
most
active exploration area in the Northwest Territories as measured by  
money
inflows. Madison Explorations is the most active explorer in Southern  
Saskatchewan.
That includes the De Beers-Kensington partnership. Madison's primary  
area
of exploration is Scout Lake, which, according to the Saskatchewan  
Geological
Survey, is one of the two most promising diamond areas in the province.
That conclusion confirms the work of Dr. Joseph Montgomery, the director
of five mining companies and Madision's lead diamond explorer. Dr.  
Montgomery
has spent more than a decade surveying the area. He is a person of  
considerable
expertise and is exceptionally well regarded in the metals and minerals
discovery business. Dr. Montgomery has been involved in more than 300
prosperous mineral explorations all over the world, including  
projects for
Diamond Fields. Based on his ten years surveying Scout Lake, Dr.  
Montgomery
believes it is one of the most promising diamond locations he's ever  
seen
and that the area could be home to the largest diamond deposit in the  
province
Madison is the only active explorer in Scout Lake, which, from a  
geological
standpoint, has many of the same characteristics as Fort à la Corne,  
where
Shore Gold made last year's spectacular discovery. Madison is currently
exploring two other potential diamond properties in Southern  
Saskatchewan,
Bulls-eye and Bronco. The results of early indicator studies at both  
properties
have been very favorable.Winspear, Dia-Met, and Aber each partnered  
with a
more senior diamond producer. Madison is currently the only active  
explorer
in one of the most potentially diamond-rich regions within a national  
industry
that is experiencing dazzling growth and whose full potential is only
just now being tapped. We would not be surprised to see Madison follow
the trend and partner up with a De Beers, for instance. In the meantime,
look for additional diamond property acquisitions and discoveries by
this aggressive upstart - and for substantial share price appreciation
over the mid- to long-term.

Shres trade in New York under the ticker symbol MDEX. Current price  
per share
is just 0.36 cents, nearly 300% above its September low.  
Opportunities as
clear and sparkling as this one come along rarely.

no case to answer.

They heard that Smith, 21, had sheared off ex Michelle Turner's

Turbo Charge Your Job Search



By Sue Levine, M.Ed., Career Placement Representative

It's the little things that sometimes differentiate you from your  
competitors when it comes to a job search. Students often wonder why  
they didn't receive a job offer when "I'm qualified and did a great  
job answering the interview questions." Job searching is not an exact  
science - there is not always a tangible explanation as to why you  
weren’t offered a job, but there are some things you can do to stack  
the odds in your favor.

Thank You Notes
While a thank you note alone will not guarantee a job offer, all  
things being equal it can differentiate you from another candidate.  
It tells the employer that you have taken extra effort to thank them  
for their time and that you are serious about the position. It also  
speaks to your character - you have demonstrated proper etiquette and  
social norms. Email is a perfectly fine way to get a brief thank you  
out to an employer in a timely manner, but follow up with a hard copy  
thank you letter for formality.

Be on Time for the Interview
First impressions are everything! If you arrive late to an interview,  
even minutes, you are sending a message to the employer that you  
don't value time. Employers want employees who are timely, and you  
should set the stage for this at the interview phase. Some simple tips:

1. Map out your route and plan your commute based on the time of day,  
parking availability, traffic, etc.
2. Drive the route ahead of time if it is an unfamiliar local.
3. If you will be traveling during rush hour or on public  
transportation - allow for extra time.
4. If you don't own a cell phone - borrow one for a few hours. If you  
are running late you can easily call the employer.

Know Something about the Job and the Employer
You don't need to know every minute detail, but you should do some  
research prior to the interview. Woe to the jobseeker who cannot  
articulate why they are interested in the position. This sends the  
message that you are not overly serious about the position.

Follow the directions for online applications
Some employers require that you submit an online application. This is  
often another way to screen candidates. Did you follow the  
instructions? Submit everything that they asked for? Were you able to  
navigate the system successfully? These things can tell the employer  
a great deal about your comfort with technology and ability to follow  
specific directions. Apply online when you know you have  
uninterrupted time and you can pay attention to what you are doing.

Don't Wear Perfume, Cologne, or other Scented Products to the Interview
While you may think that your Chanel No. 5 is the most heavenly scent  
on the earth that may not be true for the other people in the  
interview room.

Be Nice to the Receptionist and Administrative Staff
The hiring manager may seek input from other staff members that are  
not even in the interview room. A smile, friendly demeanor, and  
overall professional attitude can send a positive message.

Sue Levine, M.Ed. is a Career Placement Representative at  
Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester, Massachusetts and has  
nearly ten years of experience working in Career Services. She holds  
a B.A. in English and American Literature from Brandeis University  
and a M. Ed. in Higher Education from the University of Georgia.

Subject: Your Debts Could Make You Rich!


Your Debts Could Make You Rich!

Your debts disappear (even your house is paid off) in 5-7 years, and  
you retire debt-free... using nothing more than the money you're  
currently earning plus one of today's best-kept secrets:

Does my story sound too familiar?

I should've seen it, because each day I dressed myself in clothes  
paid for by credit cards, walked on financed carpet in our mortgaged  
house, and drove a leased car.

But even when the company I worked for went under and I found myself  
scrambling to keep from losing the house, cars, furniture, and our  
good name, I still didn't see it. Then, a couple of days later, when  
I was forced to sell my gold Corvette and my wife's Olds Regency, it  
hit me: I was a prisoner of debt.

As long as I owed people money, they owned me! At that moment, I made  
myself a promise: "I will never be this vulnerable again!" I had to  
find a way out of debt. And that's exactly what I did. But in the  
process, I developed a unique method that transforms debt into  
wealth. So much wealth, that anyone who uses it can be a millionaire  
by the time he or she retires. And best of all ... you can accumulate  
your $1 million nest egg using nothing more than the money you're  
currently earning.

And it's easy: One year after I explained my method to Jan and Jerrel  
Herron (both in their 50s), their credit cards and two cars were paid  
off. In the second year, they paid off the mortgage. Then they showed  
my method to their 32-year-old twin sons. One son quickly paid off  
his house. The other paid his off one year later.

The same happened to Ruth DeHaven of Santee, CA: "We were over  
$125,000 in debt. Today, just 3 years later, we are completely debt- 
free, including no mortgage on our house, and my husband and I have  
just retired at age 55."

And Dale Prull, from San Jose, CA, says, "After only 8 months all my  
credit cards were paid off. Ten months later my car was paid off. The  
value of my home is over $400,000 and will be paid off in 3 years and  
4 months. Following your plan, I'll retire 12 years later with almost  
$1 million."

Over half a million people are using my method, and now it's your turn.

Stop being a prisoner of debt today! Discover how good it feels to  
wake up each morning knowing you own your car, house, and everything  
you have, and you don't owe a penny to anyone. No more bills in the  
mailbox.

My method transforms your debt into wealth - growing to $1 million -  
using nothing more than the money you're currently earning. Thanks to  
the best-kept secret of the investment industry, you're in control of  
your life: free, financially independent - enjoying peace of mind,  
knowing your family is safe and you're set for life!

See how it works today: http://sedicigreatproducts13.com/t/c/186/data/ 
dz15.html

Sincerely,
John Cummuta

P.S. Don't make another payment on your home, car, or credit card  
until you hear the truth of today's 5 biggest rip-offs - from some of  
America's largest, most-trusted names. Stop making others rich, while  
they keep you poor - a prisoner of debt. Break free today ... and  
transform your debt into wealth.

Hey you, Avis

You know why I take pleasure in internet shopping? Because it's fun!
Yesterday I was looking over this timepiece at this e-store and today I
decided to grab it. I see you cutting down on nice things every week.  
This
is not too expensive so that you can let yourself go!
http://ypp.qra.meetingourexpectation.com/juh/

You deserve to have a luxury accessory and it won't cost much. You  
won't be
required to wait long for it because the consignment is so speedy.

You'll be even more stunning than others!

Get ready to have some fun,

Jonah

Subject: Valentine's Day

Hello Everyone,

Love, Relationships and Commitment, isn't that what Valentine's Day is
all about? Well so is Chasing Erections, but you get a side order of
laughter as well. And not only will Chasing Erections make you laugh,
but it will make you think and it will make you feel. When was the last
time a movie gave you all that?

And as a bonus you can pretend to all your friends that you just bought
a porn film. I can't tell you how many people think Chasing Erections
is porn. I believe that's one of the reasons that they're so moved
after watching the film. They're not expecting what they get. And isn't
that one of the fun things in life, unpredictability.

This Valentine's Day be UNPREDICTABLE and bring home a copy of Chasing
Erections. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.


Regards,

Hedley Turk

Comments in the BLOG


I put up a new BLOG today on DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM), the subject of  
the weekend edition. Apparently, it's going to take a big swoon in  
the market to knock this stock off track. I suggested using caution  
when trying to buy this one, but out of front of the pending FDA  
Approval the stock has made a new all time high today. Again, a  
partial position to get started, saving some capital for a pullback,  
is suggested. In the BLOG I note that based on where the stock is  
trading today, a good upside target for the FDA Approval might be  
around $25.
We have had some technical problems with the BLOG recently, mostly  
related to the massive amounts of spam we get in the comment section.  
Several of the recent comments and questions have accidentally been  
deleted. If you have posted a comment or question, and don't see it  
responded to in the BLOG, please resubmit. Sorry if this problem has  
caused any inconvenience.
To use the BLOG, simply go to the home page at www.otcjournal.com -  
the BLOG will scroll down automatically on the right side of your  
screen. The most current journal entries appear in the middle of your  
screen. Check back frequently for updates particularly when stocks  
are moving to overbought or oversold levels or in volatile markets.  
Your questions and postings do not automatically appear, so don't  
bother posting the same question multiple times. I personally go

In the next 10 days I'll be making the jump back to a couple of good  
old fashioned penny stocks from this past weekend's $16 idea. For  
starters, I have identified a stock in the $.50 range in the heavily  
followed Stem Cell space. This will be an OTC Journal first look  
edition. This company looks interesting because they are not just  
claiming to have some great Stem Cell IP- they are actually putting a  
mechanism in place to begin offering real Stem Cell treatments using  
non controversial stem cells. This new idea may come out as early as  
tomorrow after the close.
Then, next week I'm going to introduce another penny stock lovers  
delight. It's in the $.08 range, but has traded as high as $.13  
already this year, and had a 10 million share day in January. The  
company has some very exciting technology for utilities, and is  
teaming up with a huge household name company to market the product.
Stand by for some new ideas. Now is the time to start building on  
this year's successes.
Also, we are introducing a new format for the newsletter today. Note  
the new right hand column. I will use this new column to highlight  
either new BLOG postings or events you should know about. Today,  
there is some coverage on this morning's news release from OTC  
Journal winner TelePlus (OTC BB: TLPE). This stock is now storing up  
energy for it's next streaky move, and is at the ideal level for  
accumulation.
News From TLPE
TLPE was out with news before the open today. The company is clearly  
making a major commitment to the pre paid market. They are hosting a  
big conference in late March. Look for them to be a leader in this  
field. Yes the complete text of today's release:

TelePlus Proud to be a Sponsor of 2006 Intele-CardExpo in Miami, Florida
Tuesday January 31, 6:00 am ET
MONTREAL--(MARKET WIRE)--Jan 31, 2006 -- TelePlus Enterprises, Inc.  
(OTC BB:TLPE.OB - News) (Frankfurt:YT3.F - News) (http:// 
www.teleplus.ca) ("TelePlus" or the "Company") is proud to announce  
that its wholly-owned subsidiary, TelePlus Wireless, Corp. ("TelePlus  
Wireless"), under the brand name Liberty Wireless, will be a sponsor  
of the upcoming Intele-CardExpo in Miami, Florida. The prestigious  
event, which will take place from March 21-23, 2006, is the leading  
world venue where the prepaid industry meets, transacts, and  
networks. Organizers of the Expo expect over 5,000 attendees from all  
areas of the prepaid industry, including the wireless, telecom,  
distribution, payment, and next-generation technology segments. As  
the Expo has historically had a high proportion of top executives,  
final decision makers, and experts amongst attendees, TelePlus  
Wireless, as an event sponsor, is well-positioned to gain valuable  
industry exposure. To ensure maximum visibility for its flagship  
brand, TelePlus Wireless will also be exhibiting a Liberty Wireless  
booth at the Expo.
"The Intele-CardExpo is an ideal venue for TelePlus to showcase its  
impressive array of prepaid services since all aspects of the  
industry are covered at the Expo under one roof," stated Kelly  
McLaren, President of TelePlus. "As an event sponsor, our primary  
objectives will be to create top-of-mind awareness for the Liberty  
Wireless brand in particular and, more generally, to position  
TelePlus as the supplier-of-choice for the industry's prepaid-service  
needs. As an exhibitor, we also intend to take full advantage of the  
many networking opportunities offered by the Expo to strengthen our  
strategic business relationships with distributors, corporate and  
vertical market end-users, and next-gen providers. We have an  
exciting year ahead of us, and the Expo is the perfect opportunity to  
explain our winning story to the prepaid community," stated Ms. McLaren.

Subject: From Mr.Walter Schemid.

 From Mr.Walter Schemid.
Abidjan,Cote d'ivoire,
West Africa.
Email:(walchem4@yahoo.fr)

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this
letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it
serious. This letter must come to you as a big surprise,
but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become
great friends and business partners. My name is Mr.Walter
Schemid, the present branch accountant of a bank here in
Abidjan Cote d'ivoire.  I write you this proposal in good
faith, believing that I can trust you with the information
I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have a
transaction that will benefit both of us, as your
assistance is required as a foreigner.

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head
office, but last December I was asked to take position of
account Manager of our branch in Abidjan  who passed on, so
that was how I became the present account manager and
discovered a fortune.  As I resumed duty, I discovered an
account with total sum of $18,500,000 million that has not
been operated on for the past 4 years.  From my
investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one
Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great industrialist
and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life
in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only
daughter.  You shall read more news about the crash on
visiting this site which I got during my investigation;
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
The account is escrow call account, a secret type of
account in my bank and no other person knows about this
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no
other beneficiary.  I have kept a close monitoring of the
account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about
the money as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson,
meaning that no one is aware of the account.  I cannot
directly take out this money without the help of a
foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an
assistance to claim the funds and share it with me.  As the
Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence
the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as
the next of kin to the account, with the correct
information concerning the account, which I shall give you.

I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next
of kin to the account, so that my bank head quarters will
release the funds to yous.  There is practically no risk
involved, the transaction will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of law.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both
parties will be  satisfied.

Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel
we can work together, so we can go over the details.
  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please,
treat with utmost confidentiality.  I wait your urgent
response. You can as well contact through this my private
email at(walchem4@yahoo.fr)
Regards,

Mr.Walter Schemid.
