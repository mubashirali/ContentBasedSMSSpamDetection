Content Based SMS Spam Detection on Android

Many consumers find unwanted SMS which are annoying and time-consuming and can include commercial messages known as spam. With the popularity of smart phones and cheap SMS packages, such messages are received more frequently than ever before. 
In this project we have propose a solution for SMS spam detection. We have develop a three-level parallel classifier for short text messages and demonstrate the improvement in accuracy over traditional Bayesian email spam filters. 
The combined output of three classifiers; Decision trees, Bayesian and SVM show that these parallel layers of spam filtering classifiers give a much higher level of precision and accuracy.
We give a detail comparison of our classifiers based on experimental results using real training dataset and finally prove how these layers can help users in identifying a spam much accurately then before. 
In order to achieve time constraints we suggest a cloud based implementation of the system.
